# C_language_data-handling

Welcome to My simple class-management system program which is based on C Programming language. This program can be used to store student data and you can store a lot of studentâ€™s data as you want. 
Through this program you can store the student data like Student roll number,  Student name, Father name, mother name, contact number, Gmail id and Student address. It also store the student's total marks and precentage.
